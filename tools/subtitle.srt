cash in on the latest craze but their

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,390
real passion was human flight they began

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,010
with gliders before building up to

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,960
captured in this well-known photo taken

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,180
by one John T Daniel's who'd actually

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,670
never seen a camera before Orville had

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,829
preset the camera but Daniels was so

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,719
excited he almost forgot to trigger the

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,820

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,309

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,610
there's something truly haunting about

today it looks like something from

65
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,470
another planet but in 1937 the

66
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,480
Hindenburg was touted as the future of

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,459
commercial air travel these hopes were

68
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,680
dashed on May 6 when the German airship

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,690
went up in flames during docking at

70
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,120
Lakehurst maxfield Field in New Jersey a

71
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,220
static spark may have ignited the blaze

72
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,260
although the reasons for the fire are

73
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,750
debated the fabric skin and hydrogen

74
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,970
inside went up in flames and the ship

75
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,879

81
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,319

Japan's surrender sent jubilant crowds

86
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:19,819
cheering through the streets across

87

America in Times Square thousands

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,319

sensation capturing the mood of the

99
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,139
country since the 2010s the narrative

100
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,030
around the photo has changed since

101
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,980
Friedman had not consented to the kiss

102
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,500
however it's remained a cultural icon a

103
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,769
symbol of the war's end number five

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,079
summed up the desperation of the times

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,390
the lines of worry and the children

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,220
huddling beside her capture an anxiety

118
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,560
that was felt across the country Lange's

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,450
images resulted in aid being rushed to

120
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,910

124
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,400
symbol of doom but before August 6 1945

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,890
this harrowing new weapon had only been

126
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,830
used in tests at 8:15 a.m. that morning

127

158
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,300
unknown rebel remains a mystery but his

159
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,070
act of defiance led to one of the most

165
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,949
