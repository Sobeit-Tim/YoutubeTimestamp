00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
my name is Justin Lauria and today I'm

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,879
going to tell you five ways that you can

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,130
speed up your progress in skateboarding

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,130
without increasing your risk for injury

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,789
[Music]

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,920
all right so my first piece of advice

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,320
for you is to forge your own path

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
forward there's a lot of information out

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,039
there about the order that you should be

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,189
learning tricks but the reality is that

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,689
there's no one-size-fits-all progression

12
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:34,350
what works for one person might not work

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,730
for someone else rather than letting

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,410
someone else dictate what you should

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,270
learn next you'll really be doing

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,190
yourself a big favor if you instead

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,140
focus on tricks that you're really

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,399
excited about learning not only is it

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,620
fun to have tricks in your bag that

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,660
aren't very common it's also much easier

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,460
to dedicate your time and energy to

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,949
achieving a goal that you personally

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,600
feel passionate about achieving not only

24
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,219
that but the tricks that you enjoy doing

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,710
will also be more in line with your

26
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,690
natural abilities so focusing on those

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,190
will inevitably allow you to see faster

28
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,660
results then if you are following

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,850
someone else's program

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,430
remember skateboarding is about having

31
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,409
fun so don't try to turn it into a job

32
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,900
and don't waste your time learning

33
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,400
tricks that you don't really care about

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,590
you don't have to learn every variation

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,590
of every trick in a particular order

36
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,729
before you move on to another one

37
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,350
remember you can always come back later

38
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,270
and fill in any gaps in your game if you

39
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,920
need to

40
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,630
okay so tip number two is you should

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,670
make it a habit to skate with people who

42
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,079
are better than you when you skate with

43
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,450
the same group of friends on a regular

44
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,100
basis there's a tendency for everyone to

45
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,430
share their techniques and secrets with

46
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,320
one another and over time each person's

47
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,360
skill level will gravitate towards the

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,770
group average that means if you skate

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,720
with a group of friends where most of

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,189
them are better than you they'll push

51
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,140
you outside of your comfort zone more

52
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,570
often and you'll learn tricks at an

53
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,700
accelerated pace as you get closer to

54
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,009
the average skill level the opposite is

55
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,329
also true to a degree if you have

56
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,490
bitterly skate with a group of friends

57
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,990
who are a lot newer to the sport it'll

58
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,329
be a lot of fun to show off all your

59
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,950
advanced tricks and you'll probably win

60
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,049
every game of skate that you play but

61
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,190
the drive to get better and prove

62
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,070
yourself to the rest of the

63
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,050
won't be quite as strong and as a result

64
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,270
your forward progress might not be quite

65
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,640
as fast as it could be so if you want to

66
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,840
continually be improving yourself get

67
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,340
used to the fact that there's always

68
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,840
going to be skaters out there who can do

69
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,390
tricks that you aren't able to do yet

70
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,550
make friends with those people and work

71
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,650
together to learn something new all

72
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,270
right so now for tip number three and

73
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,980
this one has been absolutely

74
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,770
instrumental in helping me learn new

75
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,870
tricks you can use tricks as stepping

76
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,850
stones when you first decide that you

77
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,590
want to learn a particular maneuver it

78
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,900
might seem miles away from your current

79
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,940
ability level but you can close that gap

80
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,380
if you find the right tricks that will

81
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,600
slowly teach you how to do the more

82
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,210
advanced one most tricks are comprised

83
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,920
of multiple parts sometimes involved in

84
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,780
doing something very new and very

85
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,060
specific with multiple parts of your

86
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,950
body at once and trying to learn them

87
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,500
all at the same time can be overwhelming

88
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,210
so instead of just going for the trick

89
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,010
and failing at it over and over again

90
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,380
until you just happen to get lucky and

91
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,420
landed break the trick down into its

92
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,730
components and learn them one at a time

93
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,410
and then slowly start to combine them

94
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,780
and build your way back up into the full

95
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,340
manoeuvre so for instance if you're

96
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,530
trying to learn how to do a pop shuvit

97
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,810
you don't have to just start going for

98
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,400
the full thing right away first you can

99
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,320
practice how to use your back foot to

100
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,810
make the board rotate exactly 180

101
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,240
degrees on a consistent basis while

102
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,560
leaving your front foot on the ground

103
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,660
next you can practice doing the same

104
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,540
thing but this time just add in landing

105
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,010
on the board with both feet after that

106
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,990
you can practice how to spin the board

107
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,240
in the same way but starting with both

108
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,760
feet on the board and ignoring trying to

109
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,560
land on the board with both feet at that

110
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,910
point not only will you have a much

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,340
better understanding of what the trick

112
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,020
entails but you'll have individually

113
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,450
trained every muscle to perform the

114
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,610
maneuver properly and when you go to put

115
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,590
it all together you'll know exactly how

116
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,150
each part is supposed to feel and you'll

117
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,610
be able to learn the entire trick in a

118
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,200
very short amount of time now the fourth

119
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,360
recommendation I have for you if you

120
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,640
having trouble learning tricks is to

121
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,410
upgrade your gear all too often I'll see

122
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,600
somebody struggling trying to learn some

123
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,190
and all I have to do is take one look at

124
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,870
their board and it's obvious that it's

125
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,880
not that person's ability that's holding

126
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,650
them back but rather it's the equipment

127
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,150
that they're using so when you're

128
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,250
picking out components for your board

129
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,960
make sure that the decking you choose is

130
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,600
an appropriate width for how big of a

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,620
skater you are skinnier boards like ones

132
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,840
that are 7.5 or 7.75 inches wide are

133
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,360
usually a great choice for kids and

134
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,040
younger teenagers but as you get older

135
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,170
and as your feet get a little bit bigger

136
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,540
you might want to consider the fact that

137
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,460
trying to maintain your balance and ride

138
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,320
comfortably on a board that's too thin

139
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,050
for you might actually be holding you

140
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,910
back a little bit so just to give you a

141
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,340
point of reference I'm about 6 foot 3

142
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,620
and I wear a size 13 shoe and I

143
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,470
exclusively ride boards that are eight

144
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,990
point seven five inches across now

145
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,820
likewise you should also choose trucks

146
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,400
that are approximately the same width as

147
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,590
your board wheels that are suited for

148
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,690
your style of skating and bushings that

149
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,860
are appropriate for your weight I'll

150
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,240
leave some information in the

151
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,620
description section below to help you

152
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,810
get a feel for how to choose the right

153
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,240
components okay so now we're onto the

154
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,000
fifth and final tip which is to set

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,710
goals and then set deadlines it's no

156
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,930
secret that setting goals for yourself

157
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,360
can play a huge role in your ability to

158
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,790
make forward progress in skateboarding

159
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,870
and in almost any other skill simply

160
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,790
knowing what you're trying to accomplish

161
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,070
helps to add structure to the time you

162
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,080
spend practicing and it also helps you

163
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,220
avoid wasting time on tricks that aren't

164
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,800
directly in line with what you're trying

165
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,419
to do as you come across goals that you

166
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,890
want to work toward make sure you

167
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,050
physically write them down on a piece of

168
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,430
paper somewhere the act of writing your

169
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,100
goal down will help you keep yourself

170
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,780
accountable for it because not only will

171
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,000
it serve as a reminder to you every time

172
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,620
you see it but it'll also prevent you

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,350
from cancelling your goal if things

174
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,090
start to get too difficult along the way

175
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,280
however since skateboarding has a fear

176
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,020
component it's easy to put off certain

177
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,340
goals over and over again until they

178
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,740
start to appear like they're never gonna

179
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,900
happen that's where the idea of setting

180
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,580
a deadline comes in when you start

181
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,560
working towards one of your bigger goals

182
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,850
try to come up with an estimate of how

183
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,110
long it should take for you to be able

184
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,330
to achieve it how

185
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,680
