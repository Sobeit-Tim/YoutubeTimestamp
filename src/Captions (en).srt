00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,250
my name is Justin Lauria and today we're

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,779
gonna break down the ten easiest tricks

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,350
that you can learn when you first start

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,350
skateboarding

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,820
[Music]

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,279
all right so the first trick at the top

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,590
of the list is de bunnyhop while you're

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,240
riding crouch down and grab the nose and

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,060
the tail of the board with your hands

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,220
now while holding on jump as high as you

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,050
can and pull the board up with you so

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,610
that it never leaves your feet you

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,800
probably won't be able to get as high as

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,030
an ollie but this version is sure to get

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,640
you jumping off the ground in this

16
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,290
little time as possible okay so now for

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,870
the second trick which is called a

18
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,629
revert for this trick you're going to be

19
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,769
doing a 180 or a half rotation but

20
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:48,620
you're gonna leave the wheels on the

21
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:50,510
ground the whole time to accomplish this

22
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,489
first you're gonna rotate your upper

23
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,920
body focusing on bringing your shoulders

24
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:56,929
around to face forward then using the

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,519
momentum from your upper body and gauge

26
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:01,160
your core and push your back wheels

27
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,780
around until they're riding in front if

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,339
you do this properly the wheels should

29
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,760
skid along the concrete and make a

30
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,140
really cool screeching noise the third

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
trick we're gonna learn is the board

32
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,400
pickup nothing tells the world that you

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,170
haven't been skating for very long like

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,660
bending down and picking up the board

35
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,790
off of the ground like this instead of

36
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,350
doing it that way pop the tail of the

37
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,970
board down with your foot so that it

38
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,470
jumps off of the ground and then catch

39
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,290
it by the nose while it's still in the

40
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,000
air I personally found that the easiest

41
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,280
way to do this is to start with your

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,530
hand position so that your palm is

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,060
facing away from your body then catch

44
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,970
the board so that your thumb is on the

45
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,530
bottom part of the deck a variation of

46
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,120
this move would be to kick the board up

47
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,220
and then try to get the board to balance

48
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,430
on top of your foot for a moment as you

49
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,960
bring the board up in to your hand

50
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,810
the fourth trick on the list is called

51
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,640
the caveman to do the easiest version of

52
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,200
a caveman you're gonna start with the

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,840
board in your leading hand with your

54
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,670
thumb on the grip tape swing the board

55
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,770
away from you and then as it starts to

56
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,570
swing back toward you jump as high as

57
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,400
you can off of the ground and try to

58
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,680
land on the board with one foot over top

59
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,630
of each set of wheels now there are a

60
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,030
bunch of really fun variations

61
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,780
so be sure to check out my trick tip on

62
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,520
caveman's

63
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,560
which I'll put a link to right at the

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,510
end of the video the fifth trick is

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,400
another stylish and very useful way of

66
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,160
getting back on your board and I call it

67
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,630
the throw down you can use this maneuver

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,430
as a way to get up to speed on your

69
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,380
board in a hurry or when you have a

70
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,270
really short run up just like for the

71
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,830
caveman you're gonna start by holding

72
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,020
the board in your leading hand with your

73
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,970
thumb on top of the grip tape facing the

74
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,890
way you want to start riding and with

75
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,780
the board at your side start to take a

76
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,060
few steps forward as you drag the tail

77
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,010
on the ground beside you when you're

78
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,960
ready to hop on let go of the board with

79
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,880
your leading hand and jump off of the

80
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,440
foot you normally ride with in bag and

81
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,090
place your front foot on the board

82
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,490
directly over the front set of wheels

83
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,800
follow that up by placing your back foot

84
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,300
on the tail and now you're instantly up

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,000
to full speed and you didn't even have

86
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,010
to push one time if you want to get a

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,480
little fancier with this one you can

88
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,150
start with the board upside down like

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,710
this and when you drop it tip it a

90
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,270
little bit to one side as you jump on

91
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,220
top of it causing it to flip over

92
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,530
perfectly for you to land on top of the

93
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,820
grip tape now the sixth trick on the

94
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,260
list is what you might think of as a

95
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,900
wheelie if you've ever ridden a bicycle

96
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,630
but on a skateboard this trick is called

97
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,280
a manual to do a manual you're gonna

98
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,590
lift your front wheels into the air by

99
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,780
bending your front knee rather than just

100
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,820
leaning your whole body backwards as you

101
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,830
do this try to find the balance point

102
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,480
and hold yourself in that position with

103
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,670
the front wheels off of the ground for

104
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,230
as long as possible this one takes a bit

105
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,420
of practice to hold for more than a few

106
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,160
seconds but if you keep at it you'll

107
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,190
eventually be able to hold a manual for

108
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,770
as long as you want trick number seven

109
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,120
is called the hippy jump which

110
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,790
essentially just involves jumping off of

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,829
the board while

112
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,450
stays on the ground to perform this

113
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,069
trick you're going to start with your

114
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,140
feet positioned a little more towards

115
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,060
the center of the board making sure that

116
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,219
neither of them is on the nose or on the

117
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,689
tail when you first start trying you can

118
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,670
practice just jumping off the board

119
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,310
without rolling to help you get a feel

120
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,530
for the maneuver once you progress to

121
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,390
try net while moving take care not to

122
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,790
lean toward the nose order of the tail

123
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,310
too much as you jump off the board and

124
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,289
as you land back on it because if you do

125
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,410
the board can shoot out from underneath

126
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,699
you and you can end up taking the slam

127
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,650
after you master the rolling hip you

128
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,970
jump you can try landing some of these

129
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,440
variations okay so let's move on the

130
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,380
trick number eight which I call the

131
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,880
standing rail flip for this trick you're

132
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,830
going to start with the board resting on

133
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,479
the ground on its side while you're

134
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,910
standing on the ground next to it with

135
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,340
your toes pointed at the griptape using

136
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,110
your usual back foot kick the edge of

137
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,789
the tail of the board down while pulling

138
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,419
your foot back slightly to cause the

139
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:49,380
board to start flipping as you do this

140
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,300
simultaneously jump off of your leaving

141
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,340
foot and try to land on top of the board

142
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,550
after it is completed whatever amount of

143
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,570
flips feels most comfortable for you I

144
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,970
found that allowing the board to flip

145
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,650
almost two times while rotating 180

146
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,070
degrees has been the most consistent

147
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,500
motion for me all right so the ninth

148
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,360
trick on the list is the nose stall this

149
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,919
trick is as easy as positioning your

150
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,500
front foot over top of the nose of your

151
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,599
board riding on to a curb or a short

152
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,979
ledge and then lifting up your back foot

153
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,930
so that the back wheels come off the

154
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,550
ground from this position you can push

155
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,800
off of the curb and ride away in fakie

156
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,510
stance or hold the board up into your

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,830
hand with your

158
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,660
put into a fakie caveman okay so now the

159
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,120
tenth and final trick on our list is

160
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,230
called the wraparound for this trick

161
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,060
you're going to start with the board

162
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,890
resting on the ground on its side again

163
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,750
but this time you're going to stand

164
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,270
facing away from the board with the heel

165
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,030
of your back foot position directly in

166
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,710
front of the back wheels simultaneously

167
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,690
kick your foot back in the circular

168
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,910
motion to cause the board to wrap around

169
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,710
your back foot and jump off of your

170
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,900
front foot to try to land on the board

171
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,970
as it lands on its wheels and find you

172
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,570
with one foot over each set of wheels

173
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,400
for a much more thorough breakdown of

174
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,780
how to perform this trick again you can

175
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,030
click the link that I'll put it right at

176
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,620
the end of the video alright guys so I

177
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,910
hope this video gave you some ideas for

178
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,250
some tricks you can work on when you're

179
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,660
just getting started and also showed you

180
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,010
that there's really no good reason to

181
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,080
have to start with the ollie is your

182
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,430
first trick once you get some of these

183
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,200
moves down you'll have a lot more
